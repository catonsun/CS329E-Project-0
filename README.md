Group Name: Epic

Description: Our website is for people who want to look at pictures of pets on the go. It also allows Regular users to upload their favorite pet pictures onto the website. Admins are able to delete inappropriate pictures in order to maintain a viewer-friendly website. There is also a portion of the website that allows you upload your own favorite pets pictures. The website will be done through html and we will be using Github to share our code with other team members. We will also use Python with the DFlango library to simulate the CRUD commands for uploading and deleting pictures.
